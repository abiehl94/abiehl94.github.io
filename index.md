## About Me
Originally from the Seattle area, I received my 
Bachelor's in Psychology from Whitman College in 2016. After that, I spent 
5 years at Amazon working as both a Technical Recruiter and Program 
Manager.  I am currently pursuing a Masters of Information Management and 
Systems at UC Berkeley. I am interested in the ways that companies define and 
operationalize their core values into scalable recruiting practices. 
Additionally, I study the ways that information systems magnify 
unconscious bias, particularly in relation to recruiting systems and 
processes.
