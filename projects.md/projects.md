In this first project, we learned and applied some of the fundamentals of 
data science collaboaration. We used GitHub to collaborate with others on 
code, and also used GitHub pages to create a website that, going forward, 
will be able to host additional projects. A lot of this work was also done 
exlusively using the command line, something that was new for me.
